## Description 

This command line application allows developers to generate a professional README for their new project. They are prompted with an array of questions for information about their application repository. After the user answers all of the questions, they will have a professional README.md file generated with the title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Installation

This generator requires the user to install node.js and then the inquirer dependency.

## Usage 

Run the code through the terminal. Use the command "node index.js" to prompt the questions used to generate the README.md file.

Insert screenshot of questions in terminal. 
Insert walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator must be submitted.
* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.
* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.
* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated README that matches the user input and has a functioning table of contents.

## License

// WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
// THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
